Additional Elements
- 3 Firewalls: They filter network traffic in and out of the servers
- 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS: This encrypts the traffic such that if it is intercepted, it cannot be read by the interceptor
- 3 Monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services): This helps keep an eye on various metrics to ensure smooth operation of the servers.

Monitoring Setup
- it is composed of a client collecting data and sending it to the monitoring system
- Monitoring is configured to
    i. collect web server data
    ii. triggers an alert if QPS (Query Per Second) exceeds permissible limit

Problems
- Terminating SSL at load balancer level leaves traffic between the load balancer and web servers unencrypted and exposed to potential compromise
- If the Master MySQL server which is the only WRITE-Capable Server goes down, the application can no longer write to the database.
- Load-balancer is a single point of failure
