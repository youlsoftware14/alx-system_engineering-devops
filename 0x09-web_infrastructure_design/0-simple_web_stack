The Server
- The server in the diagram is located in a datacenter (a specially designed structure to hold thousands of machines).
- It could either be physical or virtual (i.e an instance of a physical server).
- The server  also runs a special operating system that helps it perform its services to the end users.

One Web Server
- An NGINX web server is installed in the server for serving "static" web content over the HTTP protocol.

One Application Server
- This application server's fundamental purpose is to process web server requests and generate dynamic content from a business logic and application database in the backend.

One Database
- The primary role of the database is to store application data.

Domain Name / Domain Name System (DNS)
- The DNS maps domain names to their respective IP addresses as contained in the name record
- The hosted website by the infrastructure; www.foobar.com is a record that resolves to an IPV4 address 8.8.8.8


Problems With This Infrastructure
- The Single Server is a Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
This infrastructure design has no redundant server as a backup if the single server present fails. This presents a "single point of failure" as the required web resources will be unavailable and the web applications would stop running as well.

- Downtime In Maintenance
Rebooting of the server after maintenance practice e.g deploying new code, would cause a downtime as the sole server would be unavailable for that period of time to carry out its functionalities for the clients.

- Unscalability
This infrastructure is unscalable due to its single server, web server, application server and absence of a load balancer to handle multiple requests to it.

Protocol
The server here uses the TCP/IP protocol to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website.
