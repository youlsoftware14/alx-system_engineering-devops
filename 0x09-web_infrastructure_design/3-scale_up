Additional Elements
- Servers for specific components (web server, application server, database server)
- 1 HAproxy load balancer (making a total of two and both configured as a cluster)

Load Balancer
- the load balancer cluster configuration ensures that if one fails, the other takes over
- the load balancers are configured in transparent mode so that the true IP of the client is sent to the backend servers.
